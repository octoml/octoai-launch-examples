# OctoAI Application Development Quickstart Guide
Welcome to the OctoAI Application Development Quickstart Guide! This guide will walk you through the process of building, deploying, and sharing your own Generative AI application using the OctoAI compute service. 

If you're brand new to OctoAI, or building, running, tuning, and scaling ML-powered applications, the best place to start is the Stable Diffusion Image Generation Playground. This end-to-end example will walk you through the process of building, deploying, and sharing your own text-to-image Generative AI application powered by OctoAI.  

If you have any questions or comments, please check our [docs](https://docs.octoai.cloud/docs) or reach out and ask a question directly in our [discord community](https://discord.com/invite/rXTPeRBcG7)!  We look forward to seeing what you build next!

Thanks for using OctoAI!
