# OctoAI Application Development Quickstart Guide
Welcome to the OctoAI Application Development Quickstart Guide! This guide will walk you through the process of building, deploying, and sharing your own Generative AI application using the OctoAI compute service. 

If you're brand new to OctoAI, or building, running, tuning, and scaling ML-powered applications, the best place to start is the Stable Diffusion Image Generation Playground. This end-to-end example will walk you through the process of building, deploying, and sharing your own text-to-image Generative AI application powered by OctoAI.  

If you're familiar with the OctoAI platform and looking for other ways to get started, see our other examples for to build Q&A chatbots that can answer questions about unstructured documents or how to use LLMs to perform plain-english quieries on a SQL databases. 

More examples are coming soon!
